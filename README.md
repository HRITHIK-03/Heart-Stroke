According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

Here, we worked on various machine learning algorithms in order to determine the best fit model for our result , which is to be attained.
